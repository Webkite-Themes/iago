Theme development client for WebKite

# Installation

Iago depends on [node.js](http://nodejs.org/). On a mac, you can install with [homebrew](http://brew.sh/).

```
brew install node
```

For other platforms, check the [node.js downloads page](http://nodejs.org/download/).

Once you have node, create a directory for your theme source files.

```
mkdir themes
```

Then you can install iago via [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/) (npm is installed as part of node.js).

```
cd themes
npm install iago
```

To start the theme development client, run

```
npm start iago
```

Then open a browser and visit [localhost:1460](http://localhost:1460) to get started!
