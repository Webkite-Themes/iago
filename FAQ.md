* Why do I need to install [node.js](http://nodejs.org/)?

WebKite themes are written in the [handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/) templating language, and the handlebars compiler is written in javascript. So Iago needs a javascript runtime available to compile your theme templates. Node.js is a popular platform that fills this role and is easy to install on most operating systems.
